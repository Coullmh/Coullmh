- ⚡ Fun fact: Built a 'tin plate' computer while at school in 1960. Main occupation was as a photographer. Went round the world twice before I was 21!
I Fortran program I wrote in 1979 is still in use! Offered to reprogram it but client belives "if it a'nit broke don't fix it! he is now over 90 so I do not bother any more He still runs a Intel 286 on a old operaring system called P from about 1981.
Keep telling him he should up-date but he is a Scotsman
